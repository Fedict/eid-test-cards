FedICT's eID test infrastructure project
========================================

This dir contains the code to build the client side
part of the infrastructure. (That should be installed
on the tester's PCs).

See http://10.2.250.30/svn/eidmw/trunk/eidtestinfraserver
for the Zetes part of the server side.

For build instructions, see _Builds/howto_build.txt
