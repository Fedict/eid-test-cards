Needed from svn:
  in <rootdir>\eidtestinfra:
    http://10.2.250.30/svn/eidmw/trunk/eidtestinfra
  in <rootdir>\ThirdParty
    http://10.2.250.30/svn/ThirdParty/wix (only for Windows)
    http://10.2.250.30/svn/ThirdParty/ant
    http://10.2.250.30/svn/ThirdParty/unittest-cpp-1.3

So you should have the following directory structure:
  <parentdir>
    eidtestinfra
      _Binaries
      _Builds
      ...
    ThirdParty
      ant
      unittest-cpp-1.3
      ...


Windows
=======

- install MS Visual Studio 2005, make sure to select both 32 and 64 bit development

- install JDK1.6 from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

- install ThirdParty/wix/ProjectAggregator2.msi
  and ThirdParty/wix/Wix3-3.0.4415.msi

- copy C:\Program Files\Common Files\Merge Modules\Microsoft_VC80_CRT_x86.msm
  and C:\Program Files\Common Files\Merge Modules\policy_8_0_Microsoft_VC80_CRT_x86.msm
  to ..\..\ThirdParty\wix\Merge Modules   !!!

- update the RevisionNumber in EidInfraWix\Product.wxs and
    change the <Product Id> to another unique value
  optionally change the version number in pcscproxy/version.rc and
  optionally change the version number in pcsccontrol/makeJarFile.xml

- open a cmd.exe, cd to pcsccontrol and run the commands in build.bat

- open _Builds\eidtestinfra.sln and:
    * set the platform to x64 and rebulid all in Release
    * set the platform to win32 and rebuild the eIDInfraWix
       (this should rebuild all win32 binaries) and create the msi.

The resulting .msi should be in EidInfraWix\bin\Release\


Linux (Fedora 15)
=================

- install g++
   to build the 64 bit stuff on 32 bit: libc6-dev-amd64 g++-multilib
   to build the 32 bit stuff on 64 bit: 

- install ant

- install javac 1.6

- make sure the pcsccontrol.jar has been build and is present
  in pcsccontrol\saved; see the Windows build

- in a command window, cd to _Builds and run ./release.sh

You should now have the following file: eidtestinfra.tar.gz


Mac OS X (10.6 and 10.7)
========================

- take a Snow Leopard (Mac OS 10.6)

- make sure xcode is installed

- make sure the pcsccontrol.jar has been build and is present
  in pcsccontrol\saved; see the Windows build

- in a command window, cd to _Builds and run
    make -f Makefile.mac           (builds all into _Binaries/)
    make -f Makefile.mac release   (produces the installer .dmg)

You should now have a .dmg file in this dir.

Testing
=======

Warning: the tests are not run automatically as part of the build process!

Below are some test programs that are made (where possible for both 32 and 64 bit):
 EidInfraTest: unit tests
 pcsctool: to test the proxy
 dlopenproxy: produces testdynamic to test the dynamic loading (Linux and Mac only)
